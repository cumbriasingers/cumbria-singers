# **"Celebrating Wordsworth" - Concert CANCELLED**

Our planned Main Concert, a commemoration of the 250th anniversary of William Wordsworth's birth in 2020, which was due to take place on Saturday March 21st 2020 at 7.30 pm in Carlisle Cathedral, **was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic**.    Although we were hopeful that we would be able to reschedule, it is now clear that circumstances will not permit rehearsals to take place and we are unable to commit to venue bookings.

We intend to include the commissioned pieces in the programmes of our concerts at some future occasion.
