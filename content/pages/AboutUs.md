## Born in the Festival of Britain

The first concert of the Cumbria Rural Choirs was given in 1951 at the Pavillion in Keswick, as part of the North Lakeland Festival of Britain celebrations, with a performance that included Act II of Orpheus by Gluck. The orchestra then, and on many future occasions, was the Lemare Orchestra; the first conductor, Cyril Gell.

We have been fortunate to continue to attract well-known conductors and choral specialists.  Recent conductors include John Butt, Andrew Padmore, Bob Chilcott, Simon Halsey, Nigel Perrin and Stephen Cleobury.    We are also able to engage outstanding musicians, including the British Sinfonietta and Manchester Camerata. For full details, please visit [Support Us]({filename}/pages/SupportUs.md).
